            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> I am a faculty member at IT University of 
                Copenhagen, Denmark, and I have been here since September 2021. Before this, I had the pleasure of serving as a faculty member in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India from August 2010 to August 2021. 
                In addition, I had a brief but fulfilling postdoctoral stint at the Tata Institute of 
                Fundamental Research from August 2009 to July 2010. I completed my Ph.D. at the 
                Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, India in 2009, where I was advised by Meena Mahajan. </p>
